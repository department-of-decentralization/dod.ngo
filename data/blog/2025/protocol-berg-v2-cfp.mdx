## Protocol Berg v2 Call for Participation

The second edition of [Protocol Berg](https://protocol.berlin) (v2) event is fast approaching. Therefore, we are excited to announce this year's **Call for Participation is now open!** We invite you to apply for a chance to speak or host a workshop about a topic that aligns with the conference tracks.

Protocol Berg v2 is a two-day technical conference organized by the Department of Decentralization and hosted in Berlin. The event is for engineers, researchers, philosophers, and anyone else really interested in protocol, network, and decentralized infrastructure. Our goal is to offer different ecosystems a space to come together to exchange concepts and technology, talk about shared open problems, and share learnings.

With that being said, let's dive straight into this year's tracks and themes within each of them, to inspire you for your talk or workshop application.

1. Networking üåê

Our first track will delve into vital tech and concepts around networking and how we can build resilient peer-to-peer architecture to advance decentralized systems. We want to invite you to discuss the challenges around communication protocols and ways we can overcome them. Something something p2p, decentralisation, federation.

2. Storage üíæ

Relevant topics for the storage track include designing storage systems with reliability and durability in mind, ensuring data recovery under adverse conditions, and creating incentive mechanisms for decentralized storage networks. It also tackles the broader challenges of resilience in the face of increasing data demands and evolving threats.

3. Consensus üó≥Ô∏è

Covering all things consensus, this track will focus on topics such as validation concepts, fork choice, finality considerations, virtual machines, and programming languages.

4. Cryptography üîê

This track welcomes contributions on cutting-edge developments in key management, zero-knowledge proofs, hash functions and advanced encryption techniques. It also provides space for exploration into secure communication methods, and safeguarding our privacy.

5. Infrastructure üíæ

Infrastructure is the foundation of everything, so of course we have a track dedicated to it. We want to hear about all things to do with distributed clusters, testing, and testnet infrastructure, blockchain-system operations and orchestration.

6. Philosophy ü§î

Innovation isn't about code only. This track will explore the broader implications of the systems we build examining topics like governance, coordination, and the role of open-source tech in shaping a decentralized future. We want to host talks and debates on ethics, vision, and the politics of decentralized technologies, ensuring that we build systems that reflect the values and vision we want to uphold.

Remember, Protocol Berg is more than just a conference ‚Äî it‚Äôs a space for all ecosystems to collaborate, innovate, and push the discussions around the challenges we are facing in decentralized tech.

Whether you're an experienced engineer, a researcher, a philosopher, or someone with fresh ideas: **Join us!** We are looking for unique (and thought-provoking) talks, interactive workshops, and contributions that align with the above tracks.
