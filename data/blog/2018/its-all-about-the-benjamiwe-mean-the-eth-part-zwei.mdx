Hey hey heyyyyyyyyy bitconnnnnnjust kidding. So with the hackathon just over a week away we are all busy getting the final touches for the BIGGEST AND BADDEST event Berlin has ever experienced.

BIG props to any of our employers/friends/family/pets for putting up with our hackacthonzillaness that we may have given off but we at ETHBerlin are perfectionists. But even more respect to the projects that have had to put up with us after they agreed to sponsor us. As much as we have probably driven them crazy with our demands, their commitment to the ecosystem is evident through their support of ETHBerlin.

Here’s some words from these awesome teams as to why they want to be part of the biggest Ethereum hackathon European soil has ever seen.

We are honoured to have the **Status** crew sponsoring ETHBerlin! No hackathon would be complete without these guys and we are intrigued to see what pants Andy will be rocking at the event. They told us they just had to get involved because, “The Ethereum developer community is full of creativity and it’s so fun to get everyone together with a focus on building. Berlin has become an epicenter for decentralization so we’re bringing the team out for this one and we’re looking forward to seeing everyone there!”

**Kyber Network** is getting involved in ETHBerlin because they want to “give back to the community, and help to build the eco-system. ETHBerlin is great opportunity for us to reach out and do our part.”

**The Graph** are excited to attend because: “The Ethereum developer community is full of creativity and it’s so fun to get everyone together with a focus on building. Berlin has become an epicenter for decentralization so we’re bringing the team out for this one and we’re looking forward to seeing everyone there!”

We have **EveryDApp** in the house and they jumped on the sponsorship train because well, #massaDApption is our mantra, “EveryDapp provides a trusted space for Dapp users and developers to explore, discover, and interact with decentralized applications. We are committed to fostering healthy growth of the Dapp ecosystem by sponsoring the talented developers attending ETH Berlin.”

Next sponsors we are excited to announce are the fab **Fabric Ventures**, “We are adapting the early, technical, and patient approach of venture capital to investing in decentralised data networks, underpinning the shift towards human-centric computing.”

Thrilled to have **Lendroid** on board too! “**Lendroid** is working on the underestimated and misunderstood area of credit. We are a non-custodial credit engine that powers financial services on the blockchain. We’re building the ecosystem of lending, with a keen focus on scalability of the platform. We’ve employed a modular and non-linear approach to the project, building components that will add up to enable margin. We’re looking to work with brilliant and likeminded developers to take this journey forward.”

The awesome team at** MyCrypto **told us they wereproud to be sponsoring ETHBerlin because, “the ETHGlobal hackathon series has become a fantastic foundation for the future waves of developers (in addition to being the starting point of many significant projects and products) in blockchain and Ethereum. We’re looking forward to seeing what new and unique project ideas come from this event!”

Next up to announce are **OST**. They know that ETHBerlin embodies the values we hold dear in the Ethereum community. They are hyped for us all, “to come together in an open spirit to imagine and build new technologies for a better world. As a Berlin-based project we are proud to support ETHBerlin and the Berlin hacker community. With OpenST we build a framework for Ethereum DApps to scale and a DApp for app-developers to design token incentives for their token economy. In the spirit of ETHBerlin, we share the mission to welcome more developers in our ever-stronger Ethereum community!”

Our friends behind ETHBuenosAires, **Zeppelin, **are all about supporting and helping our developers with their tech, “we aim to bridge new core technologies with communities looking to experiment and build a new, open economy. Sponsoring ETHBerlin allows us to help and support developers to understand how to use this new technologies, and learn from them how to build the tools they need to build this new economy.”

The team at **SKALE** is excited about the opportunity to, “contribute and add value to the EthBerlin event and global Ethereum community. Our project helps Ethereum Dapps run Smart Contracts in a highly scalable manner. We believe strongly in the values of the decentralized community and the vision of a better digital world enabled by decentralized computation.”

**Winding Tree** is on board to support ETHBerlin because “hacking the travel industry bringing suppliers closer to consumers by building open-source tools over the ETH network. Being part of ETHBerlin allows us to be closer to the hacker community and support their noble mission.”

**Opera** has since 1996 been a pioneer in shaping the future of the internet and is today the browser of choice for more than 320 million people. In July 2018 Opera become the first major browser to have a native crypto wallet.

And finally, we have the **Messari** team on board because they, “are excited to sponsor EthBerlin in support of #buidling, and to meet some of the best smart contract developers in the world.”

_So again, we are so thrilled to welcome some of the best projects in the space at ETHBerlin. We cannot thank everyone enough for their commitment to the space, hackathon and their continued support to us in the last few months. Stay tuned for the last sponsorship post in the next few days where we will announce the last of our sponsors._
