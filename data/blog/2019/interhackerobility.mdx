The hackathon may be over but the DoD is still in full swing. We just announced our collaboration with [DEVCON5](https://devcon.org/) to curate their art section and in today's news, we are delighted to announce a new collaboration between the Department of Decentralization and [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io/). We will be supporting [Diffusion 2019](https://diffusion.events/), and it will be at none other than Factory Goerlitzer Park.

Diffusion 2019 will take place on the 19th and 20th October and will focus on several areas of the Convergence Stack; UX, storage, middleware, learning and networking. It will bring together the developer community and industry experts under one roof. There will be interactive workshops and panels, deep diving into some of the industry's hot topics.

We invite all our hackers to apply! We are excited to be hosting a track within the hackathon and there will be bounties of course! There will be a Department of Decentralization Community Improvement Bounty focusing on all areas in the Convergence Stack. Our distribution/infrastructure bounty, networking bounty on libp2p, UX bounty, with a soft focus on Ethereum.

Without further ado, let's present the DoD Community Improvement Bounties for Diffusion 2019 â€” based on the Convergence Stack classification:

### Middleware Community Improvement Bounty (1,000 EUR)
During [ETHBerlinZwei](https://ethberlinzwei.com/), DeFi reigned supreme. We saw incredible projects such as the mixer of mixers S.U.D.Z, Cherry Swap: swapping interest rates using the Compound Protocol, or Ratelock: fixed interest rates for lending/borrowing. The most innovative DeFi app built at Diffusion 2019 will be awarded 1,000 EUR.

### UX Community Improvement Bounty (1,000 EUR)
We are looking for a project that truly moves the needle when it comes to overall User Experience and usability for the eco-system. Working with a nascent technology it is necessary to address the underwhelming user experience and foster new mental models that users can easily rely upon when interfacing with the complexities of the Web 3 Technology Stack.

### Networking Community Improvement Bounty (1,000 EUR)
This is a continuation of our initiative with Protocol Labs' [Libp2p](https://libp2p.io/). Before ETHBerlin, we sourced feedback from developers building on Cosmos, ETH2.0, Golem and more and identified pain points that Libp2p needed to overcome for a better experience building the core networking stack for technologies such as Cosmos, Polkadot, ETH 2.0, and many others. During ETHBerlinZwei, we offered six bounties. We are continuing this great work by allocating 1000 EUR to a Libp2p improvement bounty at Diffusion 2019. The more Libp2p continues to improve, the more teams around the blockchain ecosystem will benefit! If you would like to contribute to the bounty, [check out the scope here](https://github.com/libp2p/devgrants/blob/master/BOUNTIES.md).

These bounties will be judged by the ETHBerlin/Goerli Testnet/Department of Decentralization Collective. More details at [Decentralala.com](https://decentralala.com).

Details about the event itself, hacking requirements and application forms can be found [here](https://diffusion.events). The team at Outlier Ventures are putting on a great few days, and there will be a bit of added ETHBerlin spice, so what are you waiting for?! You can come and reminisce about all the fun you had less than a month ago.

To pre-empt the FOMO there are also other ways to participate in the event. If you are in town, or just simply need another excuse to come back to the hacking paradise that is Berlin, you can also join the event as a volunteer or mentor, for more details you can check out [here](https://diffusion.events/participate).
