We are super proud and happy to welcome everyone in our city once again. As we finalize details for the first historical conference about a testnet, GörliCon. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ let’s go through some Department of Decentralization updates, and what to expect these next few days.

### DoD Updates

1. Still paperworking. Make it stop.
2. We managed to set up GörliCon in spite of this.
3. Our DAO is delayed, but we’ve been pretty awesome at achieving rough consensus, like twice: one for logo, one for drinks
4. WE GOT AN IMAGE!!!!!!! Check the twitter thread on brand identity.
5. We continue to update you on ETHBerlin’s projects, thanks to Helena’s ETHBerlin interviews (Sputnik and Pinata are up)
6. We got new people in the team, and we’re working on a couple of pilot projects that (if they pass our voting) we’ll present to the public soon.
7. The first pilot, “There’s no Such Thing as Blockchain Art” is about to be launched and discussed at ETHBerlin.
8. Still paper working, this can’t be real.
9. Lili + Afri + MP + Helena launched the [Görli website and it’s fabulous.](https://goerli.net)

### **These next days in Berlin**

There has been a de-facto Blockchain week forming around AraCon 2019. We won’t call it “xxxx week” cause it’s cringe-worthy, but we recommend you to come, participate and enjoy.
