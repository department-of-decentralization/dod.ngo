Hello again, friend. It's been a while — but the world hasn't stood still.

Since [ETHBerlin in 2018](https://ethberlin.com/about/) and
[ETHBerlin ZWEI in 2019](https://ethberlinzwei.com/about.html), everything has
accelerated: the decay of fiat, the expansion of surveillance, the tightening of
digital borders. Inflation eats the value of supposedly "stable" currencies.
Governments around the world coordinate a brutal assault on privacy, freedom
of movement, and the basic right to transact.

We're alarmed — by the state of the world, yes — but also by what's happening in
the blockchain space. Amidst the noise of VC chains, fruit-token farming, and
mass adoption, the original ethos is fading. The movement that was supposed to
liberate us risks becoming just another arm of financial capitalism.

That's why we're back.

**Welcome to ETHBerlin³: ETHBerlin, to the power of 3.**

We're here to reboot. To burn off the cruft. To gather the cypherpunks,
anarchists, cryptographers, and digital dissidents — and to build. Not for hype,
but for survival. Not for profit, but for freedom. It's time to hack the system
again.

This isn't a nostalgic call to return — it's a forward charge. We're here to build
tools that empower, resist, and subvert. We're asking:
**How do we move from yield farming and VC extractivism to infrastructure that
actually changes lives? How do we build tools of autonomy — encrypted,
decentralized, and ungovernable?**

At ETHBerlin³, we'll support tracks, workshops, and hacking that channel the
following values:

- **Private**: there is no need for your name, data, or ID.
- **Usable**: it has to be accessible and user-friendly.
- **Direct**: it does not ask for permission.
- **Subversive**: it transforms established orders and structures of power.
- **Social**: it empowers people and makes a difference in somebody's life.
- **Clandestine**: it will not comply.
- **Independent**: it will not rely on governments or corporates.
- **Impactful**: it intends to make a difference.
- **Secure**: it does not put anyone at risk.
- **Libre**: it will be free both as in free speech and free beer.

Berlin is no stranger to collapse — hyperinflation, failed banks, corrupted
systems. We're not here to patch the status quo. _We're here to replace it._
The fiat regime is faith-based fiction, and belief is malleable. So let's build
belief in something better. Let's prototype a new world.

ETHBerlin has always been a launchpad for the improbable. Significant projects
emerged from our hackathons, such as [IPFS Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) or
the [Goerli Testnet](https://goerli.net/). And legend has it that the
[Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/blog/money-aint-a-thang) founders started their
career at ETHBerlin.

Maybe your idea is next. Maybe you're the glitch in the system. Are you ready
to fight for something real? **Expect us.**
