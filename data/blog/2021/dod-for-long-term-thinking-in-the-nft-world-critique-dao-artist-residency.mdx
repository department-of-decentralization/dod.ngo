### DoD for longevity within the NFT world: Critique DAO + Artist Residency

Since its inception, DoD has taken an active role in introducing arts and culture to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Our practice within the arts and culture and its intersection with technology, focuses and is driven by the goal of achieving longevity of the space, and of fostering long term thinking in a world where everything moves too fast and changes in a matter of days.

With two papers published, several art shows including the two at our ETHBerlin hackathon, and many many panels and discussions on the topic moderated, right now we feel like moving towards more pragmatic action.

To this end, we have conceptualised a Critique DAO, in order to keep producing educational material towards a sustainable arts & blockchain ecosystem. [Click here to support.](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2191/critique-dao-the-nft-space-needs-its-own-class-of)

The second project we’re working on is an Artist Residency, which pilot is going to happen in collaboration with the Rarible NFT platform.[ You can find more details about the proposal here.](https://gov.rarible.com/t/rr-6-draft-proposal-artist-residency-at-rarible-x-dod/1862)

We will be updating on the two projects in the coming weeks — for the time being it’s time to be heads down working, planning and reflecting upon everything happening in the space :)
