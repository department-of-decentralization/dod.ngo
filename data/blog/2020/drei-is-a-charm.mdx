summary: 'This is our third year organizing hackathons. And at this point, it’s getting increasingly difficult to think of new ways to engage and surprise you all, but we love our community and we know how important it is to keep innovating, so ETHBerlin iterates, once again. Enter DREI.'

_... just a small town hackathon, living in a lonely world, took the midnight train going anywhere ..._

Zwei was the Berliner summer party of our dreams. And we put it on the Blockchain and on the Bauhaus!

Well, actually, we know exactly where we’re going with this (literal) train. More on that below.

DREI is the third season of what started as ETHBerlin, the hackathon to rule them all. The following year, it evolved into a cultural festival called ETHBerlinZwei where we had our community experience with different environments that explored intersections with art, economics, and we even had an escape room.

But don’t let all of that make you think we’ll settle — we are not done with designing the ultimate experience.

## Let’s shill DREI

DREI because it literally means “three” in German and this is our 3rd anniversary.

But DREI is also DREI because we’re gonna have three events. It was clearly our destiny.

DREI is not a single event, it is a series of events. You don’t need to come to all, you don’t need to coordinate with other events, you just have to eventually be around for the DREI event that suits you.

DREI is not a single event.

DREI is about the natural balance the number three gives to different matters.

DREI because we can’t cater to just one group or another. We need to find a reasonable middle ground or enough options in order to meet the diversity of our ecosystem.

DREI is a critique of what we created (aka the monster events and Berlin Blockchain Weeks), which we take ownership of, however, instead of continuing to grow the brand, we’re going generic.

DREI because this community is about the hackers and not about the main stages.

DREI because we’re done with egotistical leaders — and because those leaders around should actually practice what they preach — and if they let us down, we should rise.

DREI because hacktivism still exists and because it’s our duty to protect it from rent-seeking leaders that see hackers and developers as an investment vehicle.

DREI because we should remain open to discovering new territories and try to grow as a community in numbers, cities, and in the friendliest and most collaborative way possible.

## What will DREI be doing in 2020?

![Yes, what?](/static/images/2020/miranda.jpeg)

After talking with many possible partners, looking at what worked well and whatnot, we’ve realized that we are in a privileged enough (though well earned) position to do things on our own — or even better, to help smaller initiatives grow stronger.

So, besides our ETHParis and EDCON activities — here’s what DREI is about:

Our beloved ETHBerlin becomes DREI — an agnostic hackathon and cultural festival. Nothing new here. The new thing is… that you’ll need to take a train, with your friends and foes, covered by us.

That train is going to take you to a crypto-anarchist hub — Prague. There, you’ll need to hack again at ETHPrague, which will be a more Ethereum focused hackathon with some wiggle room for you to build whatever you want.

**We’d like to facilitate the mobility, whilst making it a good bonding experience for all our community. So, even if it means working a bit more in order to get this funded — the value of bringing the best of our community to a new city, and have them meet a flourishing community like Prague’s, makes our efforts pay off.**

**So that’s it. DREI has three parts: Hackathon — Train — Hackathon.**

The exact date of this week is undefined yet, but it will be in the Summer for sure.

Disclaimer: DREI will not be part of _Berlin Blockchain Week_, but the Department of Decentralization may organize something small during that week, we shall keep you posted.

_**TLDR:** this year’s circuit has three hackathons run by DoD (ETHParis, DREI and ETHPrague). There are other initiatives in the making, we’ll help EDCON with the ETH2 Client Summit in Vienna, for instance — and if we have bandwidth we will try to help yet another city with an emergent community, but for now, this is it._

Wanna pre-order your sponsorship package? Hit us up: joinus@ethberlin.org

**YES, EVERYONE THAT SPONSORS ONE OF THESE OR JOINS DREI, PRAGUE OR PARIS GETS ON THE TRAIN!**

Did we go off the rails yet? Well maybe not completely, but wait a bit because we will eventually, you already know we have a penchant for that.
