        The Department of Decentralization is a collective of people from various crypto,

    <p>
    We are a collective, and we want to bring people in the community
    together to exchange ideas, make new friends, and build things as an
    inclusive, welcoming, and safe community.
    </p>
    <p>
    Therefore, any harmful or discriminating behaviour by anyone (volunteers,
    organizers, project leads, contributors, hackers, or absolutely anyone
    involved in our community) will not be tolerated and will result in the
    offending person(s) being excluded from the group.
    </p>
    <p>
    Members should be judged by their actions, not criteria such as degrees,
    age, race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity
    or expression, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack
    thereof), or position. We are a diverse community. So leave your egos at
    the door.
    </p>
    <h3>Be Open</h3>
    <p>
    We welcome one and all. We especially love to adopt newbies in the
    community. We foster decentralized, open communities, society, and
    technology, so we should be open to everyone and everything. We all
    bring different backgrounds and experiences. Great things can happen
    when we show up with an open mind and curiosity to explore. If you
    don't have an open mind, this group is not for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Be Respectful</h3>
    <p>
    Be exceptionally kind to others. Respect their work, time, and
    perspectives. Do not insult or troll others unless it is for banter
    (covered at a later point). We all spend our time, resources, and energy
    to be part of this group. Respect each other, the projects, and the
    process.
    </p>
    <h3>Be Daring</h3>
    <p>
    Dare to create something that has yet to be done. If you get stuck, ask for
    help - people will help you when you ask. This is a community. We create
    things together.
    </p>
    <h3>What We Create</h3>
    <p>
    Promote Decentralization. Build what matters to you. You can organize
    events, build applications, or foster public discourse. You can create
    art and beauty on a computer. Most importantly, create, hack, and build
    together.
    </p>
    <h3>Contributions in Other Ways</h3>
    <p>Banter and memeing are encouraged as you see fit.</p>
    <h3>Personal Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
    Everyone in this community is responsible for their own tasks. So if you
    have a project, it is your responsibility to manage it. We are not here
    to spoon-feed you or do your work for you. Ain't nobody got time for
    that. But we are a community and here to support you. So always reach out if
    you need help with completing a task.
    </p>
    <h3>Unacceptable Behaviour &amp; Harassment</h3>
    <p>
    Unacceptable behaviour includes intimidation, harassment, abuse,
    discrimination, derogatory or demeaning words or actions by any
    participant in our community online or in person. If you have
    disagreements with someone, communicate directly with each other and
    work on a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
    Harassment includes harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments
    related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability;
    inappropriate use of nudity, or sexual images (including presentation
    slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation
    slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing
    photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
    inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcomed sexual attention.
    </p>
    <h3>Notify Us</h3>
    <p>
    If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour or have any
    other concerns, you can always notify a project lead, event organizer,
    or member of the core group. Anytime. We will do everything to help and
    support you. If you can't find anyone in person, reach out via email:
